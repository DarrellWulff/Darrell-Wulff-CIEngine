# CIEngine

A small ECS like game engine made with WebGl and javascript to create *3D* browser games.

The game engine is seperated from the games files as CIEngine acts as one big system that
interacts with the custom models and scripts made in the game project folder.

In this first version the engine requires a decent amount of leg work to import scripts
and allow for new assets/scripts to be added. This potentially be automated.
